#Scope:

For the scope of our project, we are mainly focusing on having a working website for users to connect to, create accounts, and host their card collections.

We have decided to host the website on heroku and use postgreSQL as the database. Our website will be written in HTML/CSS/JS, there will be some use of jQuery and several APIs for pricing and card data. We took a look at using a framework like react to create interfaces, but as everyone in the group is more comfortable with basic web design, that is what we are going to use.
	
Our project is not a website to buy or sell cards, it is just a site to collect and price digital tokens of said cards and allow for users to present those collections to others in a nice layout. 
	
Our minimum criteria for success:
	1: As a user, I want to be able to create an account and add cards
	2: As a user, I want to be able to search for cards and get pricing data
	3: As a user, I want to be able to share my card collection with others.


#Pitfalls:

There are many potential pitfalls in this project.

There are going to be several APIs that we will need to learn and apply during this project. So far, we've identified at least 1 we need so far, a pricing and card data API => https://pokemontcg.io/
	
This API offers easy access to JSON data about cards, and will allow us to deliver card information to the user easily.
